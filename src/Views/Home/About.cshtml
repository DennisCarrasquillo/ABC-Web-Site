        At Business Logisitics System we have many decades of applications systems experience.
        We have performed projects a small as writing an email interceptor for MS Outlook to building a large computer complex for the US Army.
        As the computer industry shifted away from legacy mainframes to client/server applications
        to web-enabled systems, we have kept pace.

        more efficient, cost effective business solutions by optimizing and updating
        outmoded programs and cumbersome databases.

        Our latest offering, BLS Inventory Management,
        grew out of our relationships with parts distributors across the country.
